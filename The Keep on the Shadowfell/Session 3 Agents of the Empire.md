## Burial Grounds

Walking south of White Haven, the group travels off the beaten path into the woods searching for the alleged dragon burial site.  After several hours traveling through the brush, bright sunlight can be seen breaking through a open section of the canopy.  As the group approaches they see the ground has been piled up from a long ongoing excavaction, and when they fully come out of the forest they come to see the area is a large crater with three gradually sloped sides with the Southeast area looking as the entrance area.

-  A Perception Check of 20 can hear Agrid and his fellow bandits talking before the group comes out of the clearing.
- A Group Stealth Check of 20 is needed for everyone to sneak up and observe the area unnoticed, a single character only need a 15.
- A Survival or Nature Check of 15 will spot the tracks of the bandits, 20 will reveal the war hounds accompanying them.

If the group has either made themselves aware or been discovered, Agrid beckons them down, "Come! We have just uncovered the bones, you should see them! What a great find!"  As the group nears and inspects the bones, Agrid orders his hounds and men to attack!
- Agrid - Knave, 4-6 Human Guard, 2 Wolves

# Kobold Lair

- 2 Kobold Legionnaire, 8 Minions, 2 Skirmishers
- ... Need to work on skill checks for sneaking up on the location, as well as possible
