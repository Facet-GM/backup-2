# Pregame Information
- Play Interstellar on YouTube "Dust of the Empire"
- Explain the history of the world with the collapse of civilization and magic leaving the world.
- OR a recap of the previous session to explain who they are and what they are meant to do. They may ask questions about the background and history.
- Whenever they speak, they need to know that they are speaking 'in character', in order to speak out of character they should let me know somehow that we agree on before hand, ie raising a hand.

# Out to Investigate

Just as the walls of White Haven disappear from view, they are attacked by a squad of kobolds! 
## Revenge of the Kobolds!

From behind boulders and a roadside shrine to (----) spring 1 Kobold Legionnaires, a Kobold Adeptus, and 3-4 Kobold Tiro. They seek revenge on the group for their actions the prior day. While they will fight to the death, should any of them be captured to be questioned, they do speak a guttural version of Common, and when asked who they serve or what they are doing they will squeal out one word in fear, "Irontooth!" 


## Burial Grounds

Walking south of White Haven, the group travels off the beaten path into the woods searching for the alleged dragon burial site.  After several hours traveling through the brush, bright sunlight can be seen breaking through a open section of the canopy.  As the group approaches they see the ground has been piled up from a long ongoing excavaction, and when they fully come out of the forest they come to see the area is a large crater with three gradually sloped sides with the Southeast area looking as the entrance area.

-  A Perception Check of 20 can hear Agrid and his fellow bandits talking before the group comes out of the clearing.
- A Group Stealth Check of 20 is needed for everyone to sneak up and observe the area unnoticed, a single character only need a 15.
- A Survival or Nature Check of 15 will spot the tracks of the bandits, 20 will reveal the war hounds accompanying them.

If the group has either made themselves aware or been discovered, Agrid beckons them down, "Come! We have just uncovered the bones, you should see them! What a great find!"  As the group nears and inspects the bones, Agrid orders his hounds and men to attack!
- Agrid - Knave, 4-6 Human Guard, 2 Wolves

# Kobold Lair

Following the map or the instructions given to them, the group comes to the Kobold Lair.  The sound of crashing water can be heard long before any of the 50 foot waterfall is visible, the air seems to have a bit of moisture in it the closer they get.
- 2 Kobold Legionnaire, 8 Minions, 2 Skirmishers


# Post Game Notes

3/23/25 Game Night

Standing at the end of the table seemed to provide me with some area control and gave me a overview of the table.  Helped to keep things moving as well.

Things moved pretty well through the Investigative part of the session. Nina really worked the NPCs for information and Nicholas followed suit. Lilly and Vincent really could care less at times and the former was on her phone most of the time.  Is there something that could be done to increase their buy in?

Only did the revenge combat, but with the character sheets, things moved pretty quick all things considered. 

"*We are struggling with just one of these guys, how are we going to deal with the lair*" - Alice Autumsinger

Vincent seems to be more interested in a political game, wants information on why things are happening and who is in charge.

Corkboards were a hit to roll on and get things a bit more quieter.
