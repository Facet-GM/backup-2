The group is sent to a remote section of wilderness to assess the terrain, defenses, people, and the possibility of unlawful practice of magic.

Being agents of the Empire, they are sent undercover to meet with their contact Catherine Linora, to learn of the rumors of monster activity as well as a possible cult operating in the area.

# The Road to White Haven
The group is just finishing their last day of travel to White Haven.  The storm they have been traveling in is just starting to die down and move further South.  With a wagon full of trade goods they look to gain entry to White Haven and begin their investigations when suddenly they are ambushed by Kobolds!

## Kobold Ambush!

Through the late afternoon rain and mud slowing down the group, a band of kobolds has set up an ambush.  Out of the foliage rushes 10 Kobold Tiro and 3 Kobold Veres.  

After dealing with the kobolds, the group barely makes it to the gates before they are locked for the evening. Rond Kelfem is the Captain of the Guard and is the one to direct them to Wrafton's Inn.

## Wrafton Inn

The first building that one sees as they enter the walled village is the Wrafton Inn.  One story tall with a wooden roof and stone walls it is the gathering place for many of the surrounding locals several nights a week, tonight is no different especially with the weather as nearly a dozen patrons are in the establishment. It has 4 rooms for rent in the back for 4 CP a night.  

The owner and operator of the Inn is Salvana Wrafton, she is quick to greet people and offers warm meals, beer, wine and occasionally other spirits. 

[[Lord Padraig]] sits at a table in the back with a bowl of soup and a mead. Currently he is mulling over what to do about the increased activity of the kobolds, he would seek the help of the group should anyone direct them over to him. Should anyone show interest in assisting him, he will make his offer and show them where he believes the lair of the kobolds to be.

Eilian the Old sits near the end of the bar next to the kitchen door casually drinking his beer and discussing the weather and business with Salvana. He is not aware of the kobolds attacking travelers on the road, but he has noticed several of his flock and herd are missing the last few days.  He has also heard of "treasure hunters" searching what is suspected to be the remains of a dragon several miles South of White Haven.

Niran sits quietly near the door at a smaller table. She is always bidding her time to follow Eilian and take him out under Kalarel's order. Should she over hear any information being sought about cults she will intervene and suggest she has seen several members of the town meeting going behind the waterfall southeast of the town, IF the group has not already spoken to Lord Padraig about the Kobold Lair already.

Valthrun the Scholar sits with Lord Padraig and is going over notes and books. He lives in the upper two floors of the tower doing his "research" among all his books.  The lower two floors are storage for the barracks and mansion for seasonal events.

## Marketplace

Come the morning the area just outside of Wrafton's Inn slowly fills with the few carters that have made it to White Haven, as well as the local farmers. Carts of grain, produce, and other trade goods can be found, as well as two food carts that are roasting some pig.

Delphina Moongem is here as well selling her flowers, if asked about where she gets them, she directs people along the north road to a area near the old keep. Be warned though, she swears that she has spotted goblins in the shadows.

After some shopping Rond Kelfem finds them and steers them towards their next destination.


## Burial Grounds

Walking south of White Haven, the group travels off the beaten path into the woods searching for the alleged dragon burial site.  After several hours traveling through the brush, bright sunlight can be seen breaking through a open section of the canopy.  As the group approaches they see the ground has been piled up from a long ongoing excavaction, and when they fully come out of the forest they come to see the area is a large crater with three gradually sloped sides with the Southeast area looking as the entrance area.

-  A Perception Check of 20 can hear Agrid and his fellow bandits talking before the group comes out of the clearing.
- A Group Stealth Check of 20 is needed for everyone to sneak up and observe the area unnoticed, a single character only need a 15.
- A Survival or Nature Check of 15 will spot the tracks of the bandits, 20 will reveal the war hounds accompanying them.

If the group has either made themselves aware or been discovered, Agrid beckons them down, "Come! We have just uncovered the bones, you should see them! What a great find!"  As the group nears and inspects the bones, Agrid orders his hounds and men to attack!
- Agrid - Knave, 4-6 Human Guard, 2 Wolves

# Post Game Notes

Players can be easily distracted during slower set pieces, ie describing the area, NPCs, or current environment. Fidget toys suggested to keep everyone involved.

Having some knowledge of the world setting ready for the next session will help provide direction to them and steer the choices they make as a group. Giving them a broad history of where they have come from and what their mission is at the beginning.

Character sheets printed out and highlight (maybe) skills or rolls.

Pre set the encounters to keep things moving as smooth as possible. 

Remind the players that most of the time whenever they speak, they will be speaking in character.

Players really skated around a lot of the interactions to role play, but were able to get some of the information they needed to continue on the quest.
