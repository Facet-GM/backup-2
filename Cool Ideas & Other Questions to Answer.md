What is the shape of the world? How many continents are there? 

Need a more planned out history of the Human Kingdoms.

The Kingdom of Sularia is in a large desert region, how do they get around?  The idea that I have is for some type of skimmer or surfboard apparatus or caravans that travel the sands. If using the vehicles will this define their technology level of the world?

Need to consider how someone can become a demigod or a very powerful diving being, need to research into 3.5 or in the Theros setting book.

Adventure Hook/Idea - An Oracle that has not spoken or taken an audience with anyone in over a decade suddenly calls forth for one of the PCs, or the group.  This creates quite an uproar surrounding the characters as people begin questioning them about their sudden popularity. What are they told? How do they handle the before and after of speaking with the Oracle?
