Aether is the new magic power that is used across the world? How do people acquire such material? Is it mined in a crystal form, a gas that is refined into a solid form, or something stolen from those who possess magical abilities?


What is the shape of the world? How many continents are there? 

Need a more planned out history of the Human Kingdoms.

The Kingdom of Sularia is in a large desert region, how do they get around?  The idea that I have is for some type of skimmer or surfboard apparatus or caravans that travel the sands. If using the vehicles will this define their technology level of the world?

The people are based off the Unearthed Arcana/One DnD test race, animal headed divine/fey creatures.

Need to consider how someone can become a demigod or a very powerful diving being, need to research into 3.5 or in the Theros setting book.

Adventure Hook/Idea - An Oracle that has not spoken or taken an audience with anyone in over a decade suddenly calls forth for one of the PCs, or the group.  This creates quite an uproar surrounding the characters as people begin questioning them about their sudden popularity. What are they told? How do they handle the before and after of speaking with the Oracle?

# Rules Questions for the Group and Setting Ideas

## Magic
What is the stance about Magic in the world?  It is looked at as the cause of the world's downfall and most denizens have a very negative outlook on those that use it.  The extent of how these practitioners are handled depends on the ruling powers, the humans in the kingdom of Irios routinely hunt down and apprehend them. Classes that use magic may be restricted heavily and part of certain factions or nations similarly to the guilds in Ravnica.

Will it be divided like in the UA playtest rules?  If so I am not sure if the spell lists are completely the same and first impression is to err on the side of the Player's Handbook to keep the sheets easier to control.

Answer: Look into the 3 separate schools and see how much of a difference they are and make the choice.


## Encumbrance
Have we ever really used this rule?  Does anyone think it would change things? *It does give those with strength as a main stat contribute, but seems to turn them into Pack Mule 2*

D&D Beyond does keep track of the weight on the sheets, but it does create a moment of 'inventory management' game in order to keep from being encumbered.

Which version of the rule would the group like to use if we did use any of them? Will the setting of the world dictate change the minds of the group?

Answer: Yes do it.

## Hazards/Environmental

Very few times has any of our games used this type of environmental or long term rule set in the world.  All of them can really keep the players on their toes and add a level of difficulty to even everyday adventures.

Answer: 
## Travel

I have been entertained by the idea of a West Marches campaign several times, and watched a video on using hexes for the Exploration phase of the game.  I do wonder when the players would see a hex map though, without it being a West Marches setting.

## Fear/Mental Stress

What do the players consider as something that is supernaturally frightful?  This usually at least gives those that fail the save the Frightened condition. 

When a character is subjected to an effect that causes intense mental stress, Psychic damage is the best way to emulate that effect. These can have several different levels of effects; short, long, or indefinite. 

## Downtime

What is it? When is it expected to be used? When does it get used? 

## Crafting

Does anyone plan to use it? Probably an unpopular opinion, I believe that this should be done only during downtime.  I will consider some mundane adventuring equipment to be crafted during resting periods as long as they pertain to the class.

## Scheduling

The biggest point of discussion on availability and hosting.

Answer: 3-4 hr sessions.
