How many kingdoms are there in the world?  
- Human Kingdom ruled by [[The Masked King]]
- Human Kingdom of [[Sularia]], ruled by ....
- Dwarven Kingdom...
- Vedalken Kingdom, also known as the Simician People.
- A country of Beastfolk, several of the animalistic races that live in partial harmony as tribes and clans.


Aether is the new magic power that is used across the world? How do people acquire such material? Is it mined in a crystalist form, a gas that is refined into a solid form, or something stolen from those who possess magical abilities?


What is the shape of the world? How many continents are there? 

Need a more planned out history of the Human Kingdom.

The Kingdom of Sularia is a large desert region, how do they get around?  The idea that I have is for some type of skimmer or surfboard apparatus. Will this define their technology level and how high is it?
The people are based off the Unearthed Arcana/One DnD test race, animal headed divine/fey creatures.

The Masked Kings kingdom is named......
