With Arcane magic being drained (removed) from the world, does Divine Magic become the new power?  Where does it come from and how does one attain such abilities? How does it shape the history of the world going forward, ie nations, armies, everyday life? Who can use it?

Has Divine Magic become the new power in the world? In a word, yes. It is through deeds and belief in those actions that certain people are able to gather the worship needed to "step" into the rank of a divine being.  Once a person becomes the embodiment of their worshipers and has ideals that the people are able to follow and commit to in their everyday lives are they able to pass on the ability for others to cast spells on their behalf. This creates a inner circle that eventually stretches out and garners the divine being more followers and more power. In a nutshell, the more followers, and the stronger their belief in him/her, the more clerics and acolytes they will have and the stronger their potential for military power, divine gifts and other such boons.

In regard to [[The Masked King]], he is the most powerful made divine being (in the world or continent). It is through his actions forging the human kingdom of .... that he has gathered all his divine power.  The people worship him out of true love for the life his authority and rule has provided.
