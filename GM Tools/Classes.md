Where do the classes go?  What classes are considered to use Magic? This is where I will try to organize the classes and sub-classes in the world with possible world placement.

Barbarian
	Generally looked as uneducated people that live a savage life outside of civilized society.
- Berserker - Those who have been indoctrinated to serve the local authority.  These are considered by some as super soldiers, leading the charge and taking untold amounts of fire to keep their comrades safer.  
- 

Fighter
	As a basic class most every group in a position of authority will have at least this class available for common foot soldiers.
